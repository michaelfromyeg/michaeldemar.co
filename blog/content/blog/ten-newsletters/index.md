I have an addiction to e-mail newsletters. So I thought I’d put it to good use and share some of my favourites. Here are ten newsletters to brighten up your dreary inbox.

[The Daily Pnut](https://www.dailypnut.com/)
*The best newsletter, hands down*

The Daily Pnut describes itself as a newsletter about world affairs that will “make you sound marginally more intelligent.” It’s my all-time favourite newsletter. With gripping and poignant articles about current events with a (refreshing) non-American lens, The Daily Pnut captures our rapidly changing world in an enjoyable, daily newsletter. It’s a must-subscribe.

[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/)
*Business news I can actually tolerate*

Bringing you the latest from “Wall Street to Silicon Valley,” the Morning Brew is a great financial newsletter for people less knowledgeable on the jargon, but still curious. It’s consistently entertaining and lively. If you’re interested in the financial world, the Morning Brew is a great way to stay in-the-know.

[Vox Sentences](https://www.vox.com/vox-sentences)
*The news, but shorter*

Consuming one news source makes you biased, so why not consume them all? Vox Sentences combines snippets from a variety of organizations (though, you’d be hard pressed to find a Fox quote), and places them together to create short pieces on current events. Always informative and covers pressing issues.

[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/)
*Brain Food newsletter*

Farnam Street’s “Brain Food” newsletter covers a variety of mental models and ways of thinking about the world. For lack of a better term, it’s damn cool.

[BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/)
*Math explained better*

Better Explained’s monthly newsletter showcases articles from their blog which take difficult concepts from mathematics, economics, and other fields and creates intuitive ways of understanding them. Through analogies and no-brainer explanations, this blog makes even the most rigorous calculus concept comprehensible.

[The Ann Friedman Weekly](https://www.annfriedman.com/)
*Personal lens*

In this weekly newsletter Ann Friedman shares what she’s been reading, and where she’s at in life. It’s uniquely personal lens makes this newsletter consistently interesting.

[Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter/)
*Interesting nuggets from around the web*

Noticing collects cool and quirky nuggets of information from around the web. It’s the StumbleUpon of newsletters. I love it.

[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
*Asking the real questions*

A thought-provoking newsletter exploring the bigger questions, with stick figures. Because, how else would you figure out the meaning of life?

[Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)
*Scratch your noggin' with these reads*

Again, essentially just a mish-mash of really cool stuff.  This newsletter is particularly beautifully written as well. Its eloquence only makes it more enticing.

[Exponential View](https://www.exponentialview.co/)
*A nod to what's next*

With a specifically-futurist lens, Exponential View takes a glimpse into what the next few decades will hold. However good or hot they may be.
