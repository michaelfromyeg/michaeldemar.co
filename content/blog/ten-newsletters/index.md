I have an addiction to e-mail newsletters. So I thought I'd put it to good use and share some of my favorites. Here are ten newsletters to brighten up your dreary inbox.

[The Daily Pnut](https://dailypnut.com)
_The best newsletter, hands down_

The Daily Pnut describes itself as a newsletter about world affairs that will "make you sound marginally more intelligent." It's my all-time favorite newsletter. With gripping and poignant articles about current events with a (refreshing) non-American lens, The Daily Pnut captures our rapidly changing world in an enjoyable, daily newsletter. It's a must-subscribe.

[Morning Brew](https://morningbrew.com)
_Business news I can actually tolerate_

Bringing you the latest from "Wall Street to Silicon Valley," the Morning Brew is a great financial newsletter for people less knowledgeable on the jargon, but still curious. It's consistently entertaining and lively. If you're interested in the financial world, the Morning Brew is a great way to stay in-the-know.

[Vox Sentences](https://vox.com/vox-sentences)
_The news, but shorter_

Consuming one news source makes you biased, so why not consume them all? Vox Sentences combines snippets from a variety of organizations (though, you'd be hard-pressed to find a Fox quote), and places them together to create short pieces on current events. Always informative and covers pressing issues.

[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog)
_Brain Food newsletter_

Farnam Street's "Brain Food" newsletter covers a variety of mental models and ways of thinking about the world. For lack of a better term, it's damn cool.

[BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com)
_Math explained better_

Better Explained's monthly newsletter showcases articles from their blog which take difficult concepts from mathematics, economics, and other fields and creates intuitive ways of understanding them. Through analogies and no-brainer explanations, this blog makes even the most rigorous calculus concept comprehensible.

[The Ann Friedman Weekly](https://annfriedman.com)
_Personal lens_

In this weekly newsletter Ann Friedman shares what she's been reading, and where she's at in life. It's uniquely personal lens makes this newsletter consistently interesting.

[Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter)
_Interesting nuggets from around the web_

Noticing collects cool and quirky nuggets of information from around the web. It's the StumbleUpon of newsletters. I love it.

[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com)
_Asking the real questions_

A thought-provoking newsletter exploring the bigger questions, with stick figures. Because, how else would you figure out the meaning of life?

[Brain Pickings](https://brainpickings.org)
_Scratch your noggin' with these reads_

Again, essentially just a mish mash of really cool stuff. This newsletter is particularly beautifully written as well. Its eloquence only makes it more enticing.

[Exponential View](https://exponentialview.co)
_A nod to what's next_

With a specifically-futurist lens, Exponential View takes a glimpse into what the next few decades will hold. (However good or not they may be.)
