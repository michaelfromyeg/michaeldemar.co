A wrote a brief guide to GNU's `make`. Check it out [here](https://michaelfromyeg.github.io/makefiles/)!

I use `make` often in small-to-medium sized code snippets in CPSC 213 ("Introduction to Computer Systems") at UBC as a part of the teaching team. Hopefully this guide can serve students well and provide some clarity on this somewhat arcane build tool!
