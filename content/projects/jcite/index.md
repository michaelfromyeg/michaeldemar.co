Create and manage your citations without all the headaches!

### Background

This project was made for CPSC 210, a UBC second-year course focused on software construction. The course uses Java, and likewise this project was made using Java and JavaFX for the UI. I asked my girlfriend if she had any project ideas, and she mentioned she struggled keeping track of citations for her assignments, so I wanted to build a tool that could meet her needs. I felt the exact same feeling when I wrote my 4,000 word Extended Essay in high school. Trying to remember and keep track of citations can be hard if you're not an experienced writer.

### Usage

A user can create an account and manage a list of assignments. With each assignment, they can paragraph-by-paragraph manage citations (e.g., who are you citing, what page number, etc.) and then automatically generate a works-cited page with reported "confidence."

### How it's made

The project is made with vanilla Java and JavaFX.

### Challenges

I struggled quite a bit with the algorithm to generate citations, but I'm happy with what I ended up with! Maybe I'll release it separately as an API or something.

### Accomplishments

I think the project structure is quite nice, and I'm happy with the UI! It was my first time using JavaFX.

### Future

It'd be cool to port this to an Android app or something. I should also probably created a "released" version.
