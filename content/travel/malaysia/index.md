Date: Friday, January 20th

Location: Singapore, Singapore

Highlights: Depart for Penang, Malaysia

Weather: [Link](https://www.accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)

*Play-by-play and tips*

Head to Malaysia by first going through Johor, then hopping on an overnight bus to Penang.

Note: if I could do this again, Iâ€™d do this a day earlier (say, overnight on a Thursday), so that I had an extra day in Penang. But, I have class on Friday.

### Day 2

*Play-by-play and tips*

If you arrive in Butterworth, you can take the ferry into Georgetown. Super cheap and offers a nice view and intro of the island.

After arriving, explore! Thereâ€™s a ton to see and do; check out Kek Lok Si (largest Buddhist template in Malaysia), street art, monkey beach and turtle beach (in Penang National Park), Penang hill, Little India, Chinatown, and more.

I opted to do the monkey beach hike and got some great food in Little India, before watching the Chinese New Year fireworks.

This day is pretty chill. Depart for Cameron Highlands in the morning and enjoy the afternoon and evening at Cameron Valley Tea House 1 (or Bharat Tea Plantations Sdn. Bhd).

For the hostel, stay in Hikerâ€™s Sleep Port.
