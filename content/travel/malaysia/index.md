### Day 1

- Date: Friday, January 20th
- Location: Singapore, Singapore
- Highlights: Depart for Penang, Malaysia
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)

Head to Malaysia by first going through Johor, then hopping on an overnight bus to Penang.

Note: if I could do this again, I'd do this a day earlier (say, overnight on a Thursday), so that I had an extra day in Penang. But, I have class on Friday.

### Day 2

- Date: Saturday, January 21st
- Location: Penang, Malaysia
- Highlights: Arrive in Penang; spend the day
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)

If you arrive in Butterworth, you can take the ferry into Georgetown. Super cheap and offers a nice view and intro of the island.

After arriving, explore! There's a ton to see and do; check out Kek Lok Si (the largest Buddhist template in Malaysia), street art, monkey beach and turtle beach (in Penang National Park), Penang hill, Little India, Chinatown, and more.

I opted to do the monkey beach hike and got some great food in Little India, before watching the Chinese New Year fireworks.

### Day 3

- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)

This day is pretty chill. Depart for Cameron Highlands in the morning and enjoy the afternoon and evening at Cameron Valley Tea House 1 (or Bharat Tea Plantations Sdn. Bhd).

Come back to Tanah Rata, grab food, and spend the night.

For the hostel, stay in Hiker's Sleep Port.
