The course uses Java, and likewise this project was made using Java and JavaFX for the UI. I asked my girlfriend if she had any project ideas, and she mentioned she struggled keeping track of citations for her assignments, so I wanted to build a tool that could meet her needs. I felt the exact same feeling when I wrote my 4,000 word Extended Essay in high school. Trying to remember and keep track of citations can be hard if you’re not an experienced writer.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>A user can create an account and manage a list of assignments. With each assignment, they can paragraph-by-paragraph manage citations (e.g., who are you citing, what page number, etc.) and then automatically generate a works-cited page with reported “confidence.”</p>\n<h3>How it’s made</h3>\n<p>The project is made with vanilla Java and JavaFX.</p>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p>I struggled quite a bit with the algorithm to generate citations, but I’m happy with what I ended up with! Maybe I’ll release it separately as an API or something.</p>\n<h3>Accomplishments</h3>\n<p>I think the project structure is quite nice, and I’m happy with the UI! It was my first time using JavaFX.</p>\n<h3>Future</h3>\n<p>It’d be cool to port this to an Android app or something. I should also probably created a “released” version.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"jCite","date":"May 03, 2020","description":"Create and manage your citations without all the headaches!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/jcite/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/csv/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CSV Upload Tool","type":"projects","published":true}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/groUber/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"groUber","type":"projects","published":true}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","4032141823"],"slicesMap":{}}
