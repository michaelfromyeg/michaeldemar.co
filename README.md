# michaeldemar.co—v4!
This is my personal website built using Gatsby, which is in turn built on top of React and GraphQL. While this website has a lot of bells and whistles it *definitely* **doesn't** need, I was having a lot of fun experimenting and wanted to try to learn a few things! Gatsby is something I'd seen from a while ago and it has tons of really cool features. You'll also be able to see I was really experimenting with CSS and I think it turned out pretty okay!

Hope you enjoy. 

## Run the project locally

### Requirements

### Step-by-step

### Want to use it as a template?
While I won't make the current version available as a template (as it has all of my stuff on it), I think in the future I might look to release a handy Gatsby starter for personal websites. A plug-and-play kinda deal.

## For the future

- The structure is really bad, I need to use CSS modules. Thankfully this is easy to do with Gatsby.
- I need to post more content!
- I need to get more of my personal projects online so I can share them! Good thing I'm stuck inside all summer...

## Inspiration
There really is an art to personal websites. Here are some websites that inspired me when I was still planning mine out. They are really great projects by really great developers!
