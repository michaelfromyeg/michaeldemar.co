# michaeldemar.co—v4!
This is my personal website built using Gatsby, which is in turn built on top of React and GraphQL. While this website has a lot of bells and whistles it *definitely* **doesn't** need, I was having a lot of fun experimenting and wanted to try to learn a few things! Gatsby is something I'd seen from a while ago and it has tons of really cool features. You'll also be able to see I was really experimenting with CSS and I think it turned out pretty okay! The site includes my blog, grahp

Hope you enjoy.

## Run the project locally
I encourage you to read the Gatsby default [README](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/michaeldemar.co/tree/master/blog) but I'll include some project specific instructions here as well.

### Requirements
- Node.js, NPM
- Gatsby
- GraphQL knowledge is also handy

### Step-by-step
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/michaeldemar.co.git`
2. Assuming you have Gatsby installed, run `gatsby develop`... and that's it!

If you're looking to publish your own Gatsby site to Github pages, it's really simple. See the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/) for more information.

### Want to use it as a template?
While I won't make the current version available as a template (as it has all of my stuff on it), I think in the future I might look to release a handy Gatsby starter for personal websites. A plug-and-play kinda deal.

## For the future

- The structure is really bad, I need to use CSS modules. Thankfully this is easy to do with Gatsby.
- I need to post more content!
- I need to get more of my personal projects online so I can share them! Good thing I'm stuck inside all summer...

## Inspiration
There really is an art to personal websites. Here are some websites that inspired me when I was still planning mine out. They are really great projects by really great developers!

## FAQ
- Why Gatsby?
  - I've been using React on a ton of projects this past year, so once I stumbled across Gatsby I was really intrigued. Suffice to say it was definitely overkill for this project, but I think it's a really good static site generator. I'd also encourage you to look at Jekyll, Hugo, and Pelican. All good choices.

### How did you—
These are just a bunch of tricks I hope developers stumbling across this find useful. If I'm missing something, feel free to ask me!
