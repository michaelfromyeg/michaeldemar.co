# michaeldemar.co — v4!
Personal website built using Gatsby, React, and GraphQL. There's a lot of bells and whistles here that aren't *totally* necessary, but I was having a lot of fun with Gatsby so here we are! I also got to try using GraphQL (finally)--Gatsby is a great way to do that. I also took this project to up my CSS game and get more comfortable with animations, transitions, flexbox, etc.

Hope you enjoy!

## How did you—
I want this project to be useful for other devs, so below I'll share some tricks I used! Feel free to message me if I miss any you want to know about.

- ...create a blog with Gatsby?
  - Check [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) out.
- ...style the logo on the front header?
  - TODO: make JSFiddle
- ...create the arrow animation?
  - TODO: link JSFiddle
- ...get the main navbar to act like that?
  - TODO: link React Headroom
  
## Can I use your site as a starter?
Sure! I used [this](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) starter, but if you've so inclined, so you can start with mine to poke around. The only caveat is please delete all of the "content" (i.e., posts) and any images or things that refer to me. (Don't be weird!)

To do this, run `gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/michaeldemar.co`

## FAQ

- Why Gatsby?
  - There are a lot of really good static site generator options! Hugo, Jekyll, Pelican, and many more. I think the combination of React + GraphQL makes Gatsby an especially great choice for young devs to learn something new. No real wrong choices here though.
